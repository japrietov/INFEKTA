# INFEKTA
**A General Agent-based Model for Transmission of Infectious Diseases: 
Studying the COVID-19 Propagation in Bogotá - Colombia**

INFEKTA models the disease transition at the person level and takes 
into consideration individual infection disease incubation periods and evolution, 
medical preconditions, age, daily routines (movements from house to destination places and back, 
including transportation medium if required), and enforced social separation policies.
